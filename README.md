# 🍎 iOS POC - GitHub Actions with Fastlane

This is a minimal Proof of Concept demonstrating iOS app building using GitHub Actions and Fastlane.

## 🎯 What this POC demonstrates:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automated iOS app building on macOS runners
2. **Fastlane Integration**: Using Fastlane to build iOS apps in CI/CD
3. **Artifact Generation**: Creating and uploading IPA files as build artifacts
4. **Step Visibility**: Clear step names in GitHub Actions UI

## 📁 Project Structure:

```
IOS_build/
├── .github/workflows/main.yml    # GitHub Actions workflow
├── fastlane/Fastfile            # Fastlane configuration
├── Gemfile                      # Ruby dependencies
└── README.md                    # This file
```

## 🚀 How it works:

1. **Trigger**: Workflow runs on push to main branch or manual dispatch
2. **Environment**: Uses macOS runner with Ruby 3.2
3. **Build Process**: 
   - 📥 Checkout Repository
   - 🐍 Setup Ruby Environment
   - ⚡ Install Fastlane
   - 🏗️ Build iOS Application (creates simple Swift app)
   - 📦 Upload IPA Artifact
   - ✅ Build Complete

## ✨ Key Features:

- ✅ **No Code Signing**: Simplified for POC (creates demo IPA)
- ✅ **No Environment Complexity**: Single build configuration
- ✅ **Minimal Dependencies**: Only Fastlane and Ruby
- ✅ **Artifact Output**: Generates downloadable IPA file
- ✅ **Clear Step Names**: Visible step names in GitHub Actions UI
- ✅ **Swift App Creation**: Dynamically creates iOS app structure

## 🎮 Usage:

1. Push code to trigger workflow
2. Check Actions tab in GitHub
3. See clear step names: "📥 Checkout Repository", "🐍 Setup Ruby Environment", etc.
4. Download IPA artifact from completed workflow

## 🎉 POC Success Criteria:

- ✅ GitHub Actions can run on macOS
- ✅ Fastlane can be installed and executed
- ✅ iOS app structure can be created programmatically
- ✅ IPA artifacts can be generated and uploaded
- ✅ Step names are visible in GitHub Actions UI

This POC proves that GitHub Actions can successfully build iOS applications using Fastlane, providing a foundation for migrating from Azure DevOps.
